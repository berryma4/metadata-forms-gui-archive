# Copy essential files to a named directory
# that will allow a basic demonstration form
# to be rendered.   Needed this because 
# the extent of demonstrations in this repo
# can make the system seem larger than needed
# I also wanted the ability to safely update a 
# repo with only the mforms contents without chaning
# user local forms.
#
# Operation:   
#  To create a new diretory with minimum content needed 
#  to run the forms system and start building your own 
#  server run this script naming the directory where you 
#  want to target.   EG: If updating ../test1
#
#  bash update-other-repo.sh ../test1
#
# If you want to publish for gitpages then runn
# update-gitpages.sh
#
# Re-run whenever you want to update your local copy
# of the mforms libraries.  You would normally do a 
# git clone or git pull of 
#
# WIP UNDER CONSTRUCTION
