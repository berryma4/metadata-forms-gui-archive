<h1>Meta data driven forms GUI for REST services</h1>

<h2>Demo Using Ajax to Server</h2>

<p>
Note:  Samples shown at .....io are servered from a static HTTP server.  While the dynamic forms system will work from a static server  It is not possible to save data on server from this demo page.  If you wish to save data you will need to download the repository and run the embedded server.    The design assumption is that you will provide a HTTP / JSON server capable of processing the PUT, POST, DELETE commands for your local domain.  The demo server does this but it does not apply local domain logic.
